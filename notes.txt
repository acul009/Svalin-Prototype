Certificate structure:

- Root
  - User 1
    - Machine 1
    - Machone 2
  - User 2
    - Machine 3
    - Machine 4


Security Layers:

1) mTLS - verify certificate chain up to root
2.1) Signed rpc requests - verify certificate chain up to root
2.2) Signed rpc responses - verify certificate chain up to root
3) check permissions of certificate/actor (root is always allowed)
4) EC-DH encrypted tunnel


To initiate:
1) create root certificicate 
2) upload root certificate (needs to bypass 1 and 2 - message should be verified against provided root later)
